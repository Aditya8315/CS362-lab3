This Repo contains the Implementation of Travelling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing.
TSPwithGreedy.ipynb and TSPwithGSA.ipynb are two files which are our python implementation for this Problem.

There are 5 VLSI datasets on which we tested our code and there is one real life example to find a optimum cost tour of 20 tourist locations of Rajasthan.
